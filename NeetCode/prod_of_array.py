# Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] 
# is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

# The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

nums = [1, 3, 2]
# 6, 2, 3
